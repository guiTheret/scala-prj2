Class Exam Instruction: Building a ZIO Application Backend
Topic
Building a REST API using the "Major League Baseball Dataset" from Kaggle. Through this exercise, the objective is to understand how to manipulate a business domain, its logic as well as persistence (database) and exposure (REST API). Examples of endpoints and suggestions will be given below, but you are free to create your own.

Dataset Description
The "Major League Baseball Dataset" from Kaggle is a comprehensive collection of data related to Major League Baseball (MLB) games, players, teams, and statistics. The dataset contains information about game-by-game Elo ratings and forecasts back to 1871. You can visit the Kaggle page for a more detailed description of the dataset.

The dataset is available in CSV format: mlb_elo.csv contains all data: mlb_elo_latest.csv contains data for only the latest season. No need to register and download the files from Kaggle, they are available in Teams group's files tab.

The smallest file represents the latest season available (2021), without games results. It can help you to start understanding the data, work on a smaller file, but at the end it is expected to initialize the database with mlb_elo.csv.

Ratings Systems: ELO and MLB Predictions
The dataset includes two ratings systems, ELO and MLB Predictions, which are used to evaluate teams' performance and predict game outcomes:

ELO: The ELO rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of teams in two-player games, such as chess. In the context of MLB, the ELO rating system assigns a numerical rating to each team, which reflects their relative strength. The rating is updated based on game outcomes, with teams gaining or losing points depending on the result of the match.

MLB Predictions: The MLB Predictions rating system utilizes various statistical models and algorithms to predict game outcomes. It takes into account factors such as team performance, player statistics, historical data, and other relevant factors to generate predictions for upcoming games.

Expectations
Design and implement data model: You should design appropriate data model to represent games, teams, players, and the two ratings systems (ELO and MLB Predictions) depending on what you chose to implement in your endpoints. Consider using functional programming principles and immutable data structures such as case classes when possible.

Use ZIO and related libraries: Build your application backend using Scala 3 and leverage the power of ZIO. Utilize libraries such as zio-jdbc, zio-streams, zio-json, or zio-http to handle database operations, stream processing, JSON parsing, and HTTP application, respectively.

Database initialization at startup: Implement a mechanism to initialize the H2 database engine at application startup. You can use ZIO for managing the initialization process and setting up the required database schema. To process CSV, you can use the tototoshi/scala-csv library. Load the complete mlb_elo.csv file, using the columns required your data model.

Dedicated endpoint for database initialization: Alternatively create a dedicated endpoint in your REST API that triggers the database initialization process. This optional endpoint should be used to initialize the database and ensure it is ready for use.

Endpoints for accessing game history and making predictions (or any other endpoints related to your use case): Implement additional endpoints that allow users to query and retrieve game history and make predictions for future games. These endpoints should be designed to provide relevant information and facilitate interaction with the MLB dataset. Be creative and explain your motivation in your project README file.

Git repository and documentation quality: Set up a Git repository to manage your application's source code. Ensure that your repository is well-organized, contains appropriate commits, and has a clear README file. Document your code, including class and method-level comments, explaining the purpose and functionality of each component.

Implement tests: Write test cases to validate the functionality of your application. Consider using frameworks like ScalaTest or ZIO Test to write unit tests that cover critical components of your codebase.

Consider functional properties: Wherever applicable, emphasize functional programming principles such as immutability, referential transparency, and composability. Use appropriate abstractions and design patterns to enhance code modularity and maintainability.

Additional Requirements
Group Size: Form groups of up to 4 students. You are encouraged to collaborate and discuss ideas within your group but ensure that each member actively contributes to the project.

Due Date: The project is expected to be completed within one week after the class. Submit your project by the specified due date and time. Late submissions may incur penalties unless prior arrangements have been made with the instructor.

Language: Use English for code, comments and documentation.

Deliverables
Scala 3 code implementing the ZIO application, adhering to the given requirements and expectations.

Git repository containing your code with appropriate commits and a README file providing instructions on how to run and test your application and the decisions made (libraries, data structure(s), algorithm and its performance, ...).

Documentation explaining the purpose, functionality, and usage of your application, along with any external libraries used.

Grading
Your solution will be graded based on the following criteria, with equal distribution of the number of points on criteria 1 to 5:

Correctness and functionality of the application implementation.

Quality the data model and adherence to functional programming principles.

Effective usage of ZIO, including ecosystem libraries.

Testing completeness and effectiveness, covering various scenarios.

Quality and clarity of code organization and documentation, including the README file.

Collaboration within the group and active participation of each member.

Timely submission of the project by the specified due date.

Additional Information
The complete code below is available as a complete Scala project and downloadable from your Teams group workspace. Here are the most significant parts.

Data Model
First, we are defining a case class to represents games. Your solution should include scores, predictions, ... In this example, we are using opaque types, but this is optional.

final case class Game(
    date: GameDate,
    season: SeasonYear,
    playoffRound: Option[PlayoffRound],
    homeTeam: HomeTeam,
    awayTeam: AwayTeam
)
In the Game companion object, we are providing encoders and decoders for JSON and JDBC.

object Game {

  given CanEqual[Game, Game] = CanEqual.derived
  implicit val gameEncoder: JsonEncoder[Game] = DeriveJsonEncoder.gen[Game]
  implicit val gameDecoder: JsonDecoder[Game] = DeriveJsonDecoder.gen[Game]

  def unapply(game: Game): (GameDate, SeasonYear, Option[PlayoffRound], HomeTeam, AwayTeam) =
    (game.date, game.season, game.playoffRound, game.homeTeam, game.awayTeam)

  // a custom decoder from a tuple
  type Row = (String, Int, Option[Int], String, String)

  extension (g:Game)
    def toRow: Row =
      val (d, y, p, h, a) = Game.unapply(g)
      (
        GameDate.unapply(d).toString,
        SeasonYear.unapply(y),
        p.map(PlayoffRound.unapply),
        HomeTeam.unapply(h),
        AwayTeam.unapply(a)
      )

  implicit val jdbcDecoder: JdbcDecoder[Game] = JdbcDecoder[Row]().map[Game] { t =>
      val (date, season, maybePlayoff, home, away) = t
      Game(
        GameDate(LocalDate.parse(date)),
        SeasonYear(season),
        maybePlayoff.map(PlayoffRound(_)),
        HomeTeam(home),
        AwayTeam(away)
      )
    }
}
Database Layer
To be able to interact with the database, we first need to create a datasource, called ZConnectionPool in ZIO JDBC. We are using the default pool configuration, defining a user and a password and configuring a mlb in memory.

val createZIOPoolConfig: ULayer[ZConnectionPoolConfig] =
  ZLayer.succeed(ZConnectionPoolConfig.default)

val properties: Map[String, String] = Map(
  "user" -> "postgres",
  "password" -> "postgres"
)

val connectionPool: ZLayer[ZConnectionPoolConfig, Throwable, ZConnectionPool] =
  ZConnectionPool.h2mem(
    database = "mlb",
    props = properties
  )
Then, we can define some queries, like CREATE TABLE, INSERT or SELECT. Note that every queries results are of type ZIO, with ZConnectionPool as environment (dependency) and Throwable as effect type in case of errors.

val create: ZIO[ZConnectionPool, Throwable, Unit] = transaction {
    execute(
      sql"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS games(date DATE NOT NULL, season_year INT NOT NULL, playoff_round INT, home_team VARCHAR(3), away_team VARCHAR(3))"
    )
  }

val insertRows: ZIO[ZConnectionPool, Throwable, UpdateResult] = {
  val rows: List[Game.Row] = games.map(_.toRow)
  transaction {
    insert(
      sql"INSERT INTO games(date, season_year, playoff_round, home_team, away_team)".values[Game.Row](rows)
    )
  }
}

val count: ZIO[ZConnectionPool, Throwable, Option[Int]] = transaction {
  selectOne(
    sql"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM games".as[Int]
  )
}
HTTP Endpoints
You can configure static endpoints like:

val static: App[Any] = Http.collect[Request] {
  case Method.GET -> Root / "text" => Response.text("Hello MLB Fans!")
  case Method.GET -> Root / "json" => Response.json("""{"greetings": "Hello MLB Fans!"}""")
}.withDefaultErrorResponse
Or integrate your database layer and application logic in dynamic endpoints. In the example below, you can see that or depedency to ZConnectionPool is made explicit by the type App[ZConnectionPool].

val endpoints: App[ZConnectionPool] = Http.collectZIO[Request] {
  case Method.GET -> Root / "games" / "count" =>
    for {
      count: Option[Int] <- count
      res: Response = countResponse(count)
    } yield res
  case _ =>
    ZIO.succeed(Response.text("Not Found").withStatus(Status.NotFound))
}.withDefaultErrorResponse
Once our endpoints are defined, we can declare the globale application logic and its dependencies, ZConnectionPool and Server (for HTTP server). In the example, we are creating the table first, inserting the sample data and the configuring the server routes with both static and dynamic endpoints.

val appLogic: ZIO[ZConnectionPool & Server, Throwable, Unit] = for {
  _ <- create *> insertRows
  _ <- Server.serve[ZConnectionPool](static ++ endpoints)
} yield ()
Finaly, we are overriding the run method of the ZIOAppDefault class:

override def run: ZIO[Any, Throwable, Unit] =
  appLogic.provide(createZIOPoolConfig >>> connectionPool, Server.default)
Build Configuration
Here's the associated build.sbt file for the skeleton code provided above:

val scala3Version = "3.3.0"
val h2Version = "2.1.214"
val scalaCsvVersion = "1.3.10"
val zioVersion = "2.0.6"
val zioSchemaVersion = "0.4.8"
val zioJdbcVersion = "0.0.2"
val zioJsonVersion = "0.5.0"
val zioHtppVersion = "3.0.0-RC2"

lazy val root = (project in file("."))
  .settings(
    name := "mlb-api",
    version := "1.0",

    scalaVersion := scala3Version,

    libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
      "com.h2database" % "h2" % h2Version,
      "dev.zio" %% "zio" % zioVersion,
      "dev.zio" %% "zio-streams" % zioVersion,
      "dev.zio" %% "zio-schema" % zioSchemaVersion,
      "dev.zio" %% "zio-jdbc" % zioJdbcVersion,
      "dev.zio" %% "zio-json" % zioJsonVersion,
      "dev.zio" %% "zio-http" % zioHtppVersion,
      "com.github.tototoshi" %% "scala-csv" % scalaCsvVersion,
    ).map(_ % Compile),
    libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
      "org.scalameta" %% "munit" % "0.7.29"
    ).map(_ % Test)
  )
Make sure to place this build.sbt file in the root directory of your project. Adjust the dependencies' versions as necessary, and add any additional dependencies required for your project.

This is a basic build.sbt configuration. Depending on your project's requirements, you may need to add more settings, such as resolvers, additional libraries, plugins or configurations for code formatting, coverage, and more.

Streams
In the example above, insertRows is very simple and takes no parameter. You may want to make it a function and use a stream to batch insert your data at initialization time.

for {
  conn <- create
  source <- ZIO.succeed(CSVReader.open(???))
  stream <- ZStream
    .fromIterator[Seq[String]](source.iterator)
    .map[???](???)
    .grouped(???)
    .foreach(chunk => insertRows(???))
  _ <- ZIO.succeed(source.close())
  res <- select
} yield res
Running and Testing
Finally, it is encouraged to use sbt-revolver in your workflow. This is a plugin for SBT enabling a super-fast development turnaround for your Scala applications. It supports the following features: * Starting and stopping your application in the background of your interactive SBT shell (in a forked JVM). * Triggered restart: automatically restart your application as soon as some of its sources have been changed.

Add the following dependency to your project/plugins.sbt:

addSbtPlugin("io.spray" % "sbt-revolver" % "0.10.0")
You can then use ~reStart to go into "triggered restart" mode. Your application starts up and SBT watches for changes in your source (or resource) files. If a change is detected SBT recompiles the required classes and sbt-revolver automatically restarts your application. When you press <ENTER> SBT leaves "triggered restart" and returns to the normal prompt keeping your application running.

Compile then run project with auto reload thanks to sbt-revolver:

$ sbt
[...]
sbt:mlb-api> compile
sbt:mlb-api> ~reStart
This will create a server, listening on 8080 by default. Test your API with a tool like Postman or the curl:

$ curl -s -D - -o /dev/null "http://localhost:8080/text"
Summary
This skeleton code provides a basic structure for your application. You can start by fixing the FIXME placeholders with the appropriate code to handle database operations, retrieve game history, make predictions, and handle other functionalities as per your requirements. Feel free to make any modification to this skeleton.

Take your time discovering the ZIO ecosystem by reading the official documentation.

Good luck with your exam, and feel free to ask any further questions!
